An interactive player aid for the board game
[Indonesia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19777/indonesia).

### Merger calculator

Indoneasier's merger calculator can take the place of a mergers cost
lookup table, printed or electronic. The goal is to handle the details
of merger calculations, leaving the players free to consider the strategy
of the merge.

### Player aids

Rules summaries are included to help while playing the game. These are
designed to serve as a refresher for someone returning the game, and to
help with the flow of a game that is in progress.

## Thanks
